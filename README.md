## About Clique

Inspired by https://height.app/. Clique is a tool made to help teams collaborate and manage tasks and projects in a seamless, stress-free manner. Clique's codebase follows design principles and conventions discussed in Wacky Studio's Build an API with Laravel. 

- A flat hierarchy (any team member can assign or unassign tasks to colleagues)
- Users have access to projects only by invitation
- Tasks have a "status" tag to show their current state
- Robust notification system geared at keeping all collaborators fully informed.
- Well-documented API
- Follows Test Driven Development best practices with both unit and feature tests, and the JSON:API Specification.

Todo

- Workspaces for projects
- In-website messaging system
- Twitter-like user tagging in the messaging system
- and more
